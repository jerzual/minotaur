# Minotaur

An attempt at making an old school dungeon crawler/FPS. And also, use gulp, browserify, three.js, cordova.

## Features

 * A procedurally generated labyrinth, composed of rooms and corridors.
 * Rooms, are combat arenas, corridors are rest/peace ful spaces.
 * The goal is to kill the minotaur.
 * You only have mana spells and melee weapons.
 * It plays like a turn based dungeon crawler, but with (browser) 3D.

## Technical stuff

Like a lot of my projects the main goal here is to experiment with technology and programming paradigms.
here we will be playing with :

* browser 3D thanks to webGL and ThreeJS
* MVC for the game UI, whatever works for the 3D scene.
* Ecmascript 2015 cause it's the future.

## Graphics

Still nothing for now, all in my head, I would really like to use Three.js and Voxels, i'm currently experimenting with MagicaVoxel, go check it out, it's awesome.

## Current Progress

There's a dungeon generator in place, also first draft of UI/ Three.js renderer. Nothing fixed in stone.

## Contribute

If you're willing to contribute, you're welcome, i need voxel artists currently cause i suck at it. And if you're good in programming, you're welcome too.
