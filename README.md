# Minotaur

An attempt at making an old school dungeon crawler/FPS. And also, use gulp, browserify, three.js, cordova.

## Features

 * A procedurally generated labyrinth.
 * The goal is to kill the minotaur in the center of it.
 * You only have mana spells and melee weapons.
 * It plays like a dungeon crawler, but in 3D.


## Technical stuff

Like a lot of my projects the main goal here is to experiment with technology and programming paradigms.
here we will be playing with :

* browser 3D thanks to webGL and ThreeJS
* MVC for the main UI, whatever works for the 3D scene.


## Graphics

Still nothing for now, all in my head, I would really like to use Three.js and Voxels, i'm currently experimenting with MagicaVoxel, go check it out, it's awesome.

## Contribute

If you're willing to contribute, you're welcome, i need voxel artists currently cause i suck at it. And if you're good in programming, you're welcome too.
